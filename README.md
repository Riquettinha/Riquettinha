### Hi, my name is Isabella and I welcome you to my GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ’» I've worked with a lot of things, so I will try to resume. My main language is C#, but I also know a little bit about Javascript and had already had some adventures in some other languages.
I'm used to both .NET Framework and Core, and I'm always trying to keep up with the versions.
My preference for a development environment is Visual Studio (I like the VS Community, don't judge me), but I can make things work even without it (I just rather not).
My favorite project managing framework is Scrum, but I often find myself realizing that somethings are better handled by Kanban.
I don't have any experience using another cloud computing platform other than Azure, but I don't dismiss Amazon, I just only had experience with one of them, and because of it I'm more experienced in Azure and it's services.
I really like to develop API's and Web Applications, but if it's needed I can developer Desktop and Mobile apps too.
Even tho is not my specialty I like frontend development, my experience with it is very limited, and I'm still just starting to learn how to use Typescript, but I still like this field.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on organizing a schedule to be able to effectively finish more things during the day, instead of starting and stopping a bunch of things and finish the day with a lot of half-done work. The app Habitica has been helping me a lot, is always fun to gamify my life.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Design Patterns and how and when to use each one. And also I'm trying to review the basics of Algorithms and Data Structures.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help to participate in some Hackton, which is something that I've always wanted to have but was too afraid to do. But now I'm ready for it.
And I'm also trying to start to collaborate more here, but I'm stuck in "How to start?", but this is probably something that I just need some free time and a good Youtube video to help me.

- ðŸ“« You can always contact me on my Twitter @Riquettinha, I'm always there bragging about my victories and complaining about my problems in the IT field and always talking about games and cats (Mines and the rescued ones that I'm always taking care of).

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/her

- âš¡ Fun fact: You can also contact me to talk about games (I'm a lot into CS:GO, but now I'm into COD Mobile) and mangÃ¡s. Why do I specify mangÃ¡s do you may question? I'm very anxious and just can't wait for the anime, so I will always read de mangÃ¡ after or even before the anime, so be aware that I may unnoticing spoiler something.
